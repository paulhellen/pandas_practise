# Pandas Practice: CSA Python Workshop – Day 2 & 3

This project is a practice notebook created as part of **Day Two and Day Three** of the **CSA Python Workshop**. It focuses on key data science skills including:

- 🧹 **Data Wrangling** – cleaning and preparing data
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – creating plots to understand patterns
- 📈 **Data Analysis** – performing exploratory data analysis on a sample dataset

The goal is to apply workshop knowledge in a practical way by importing a dataset and using Pandas and visualization libraries to explore and analyze the data.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda

## 📂 Project Structure


## 📥 Dataset

A sample dataset will be imported for analysis in the notebook. The focus will be on applying learned techniques to clean, visualize, and analyze real-world data.

## 💡 Objectives

- Practice loading, cleaning, and exploring data
- Apply Pandas operations like filtering, grouping, and summarizing
- Visualize insights using Matplotlib or Seaborn
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## ✅ Status

This project is in progress and reflects learning outcomes from **Day 2 and 3** of the CSA Python Workshop. More updates may follow as the workshop continues.
